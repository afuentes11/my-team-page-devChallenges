## Overview

The project consists of the creation of a page for the presentation of a software development team. [The original design](https://www.figma.com/file/F8d1qJsorEdY47N74HLxQ4?chrome=DOCUMENTATION&embed_host=astra&kind=&node-id=0%3A1&viewer=1) was provided by Devchallenges in the challenge.

The page can be viewed at the following [link](https://afuentes11.github.io/my-team-page-devChallenges/). If you liked the project, give me a star ‚≠ê.

The key points for the development of the layout were the use of flexbox for the organisation of the images and the responsive design, and the use of the property "writing-mode: vertical-rl", which allows the letters to be placed vertically on the page.
